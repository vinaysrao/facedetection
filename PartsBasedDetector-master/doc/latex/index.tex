\hyperlink{classPartsBasedDetector}{Parts\-Based\-Detector} is a visual object recognition technique described in the following series of papers by Deva Ramanan\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item X. Zhu and D. Ramanan. \char`\"{}\-Face detection, pose estimation and landmark localization
  in the wild\char`\"{}, Internation Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (C\-V\-P\-R), 2012

\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item P. Felzenszwalb, R. Girshick, D. Mc\-Allester and D. Ramanan. \char`\"{}\-Object detection with
  disciminatively trained part based models\char`\"{}, Journal on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (P\-A\-M\-I), 2010
\end{DoxyItemize}

Holistic appearance of complex deformations are difficult to model directly, so parts based models break a holistic detector into a series of smaller \char`\"{}part\char`\"{} detectors with geometric constraints enforcing particular spatial relationships between the parts. In this manner, deformation of individual parts can be assumed to be linear, and the geometric constraints can be approximated by a linear subspace, spring-\/mass damper system, etc.

\hyperlink{classPartsBasedDetector}{Parts\-Based\-Detector} can detect many types of objects including\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Rigid objects (coffee mugs)
\item Objects of common semantic class but different appearance (chairs)
\item Deformable objects (faces)
\item Articulated objects (human bodies)
\end{DoxyItemize}

The model supports three main features\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item search across scale
\item multiple components (different views of an object where a different subset of parts might be visible in each view, frontal and profile faces for example)
\item multiple mixtures (each part may have multiple components or \char`\"{}views\char`\"{} such as a closed vs open hand, or a vertically oriented vs a horizontally oriented hand
\end{DoxyItemize}

The capacity of the classifier is largely a product of the training data supplied

Detecting objects using the \hyperlink{classPartsBasedDetector}{Parts\-Based\-Detector} requires three main steps\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Instantiation of model classes
\item Detection
\item Visualization
\end{DoxyItemize}

The following example code shows a common way to perform this pipeline\-: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{comment}{// create the model object and deserialize it}
\hyperlink{classMatlabIOModel}{MatlabIOModel} model;
model.\hyperlink{classMatlabIOModel_a223538821bf7944a26433f7f99017f8b}{deserialize}(argv[1]);

\textcolor{comment}{// create the PartsBasedDetector and distribute the model parameters}
\hyperlink{classPartsBasedDetector}{PartsBasedDetector<double>} pbd;
pbd.\hyperlink{classPartsBasedDetector_a351a499cb2d7ab23d388a34c1c8f38a0}{distributeModel}(model);

\textcolor{comment}{// load the image from file}
Mat im = imread(argv[2]);

\textcolor{comment}{// detect potential candidates in the image}
vector<Candidate> candidates;
pbd.\hyperlink{classPartsBasedDetector_a70c77effade6c39b06ddc0102973a1f8}{detect}(im, candidates);

\textcolor{comment}{// visualize the best 5 detection candidates}
\hyperlink{classVisualize}{Visualize} visualize(model.\hyperlink{classModel_aeae6527ff13db7724c53c942029d882d}{name}());
\textcolor{keywordflow}{if} (candidates.size() > 0) \{
 Mat canvas;
  \hyperlink{classCandidate_a7e0776d9b8b7496d49f46298e93d0271}{Candidate::sort}(candidates);
  visualize.candidates(im, candidates, 5, canvas, \textcolor{keyword}{true});
  visualize.image(canvas);
  waitKey();
\}
\end{DoxyCode}


And that's all there is to it!

Multiple pre-\/trained models are available. Currently included are\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Human body detector
\item Face detector
\end{DoxyItemize}

\hyperlink{classModel}{Model} training is currently only supported via Matlab code provided by Deva Ramanan. \hyperlink{classMatlabIOModel}{Matlab\-I\-O\-Model} provides a method for deserializing models generated by Matlab and saved in the .Mat format.
